<h1>Interesting Facts</h1>
</br>
<h2>1. Sand Cats Share Their Name With an Alcoholic Drink</h2>
<p>This small feline goes by the names "sand cat" and "sand dune cat," but its scientific name is a bit more interesting: Felis margarita.</p>
</br>
<h2>2. They Are the Only Cat That Lives Primarily in the Desert</h2>
<p>Sand cats do not need much water at all. They can go for weeks without a single sip, getting all the moisture they need from the prey they consume.</p>
</br>
<h2>3. Sand Cats Bark Like Dogs</h2>
<p>When taking a break from its solitary lifestyle and looking for a mate, the sand cat uses mews and bark-like vocalizations as a mating call. The sounds have been likened to the high-pitched rasps of small dogs like chihuahuas.</p>
