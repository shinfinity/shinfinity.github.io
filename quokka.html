<h1>Quokkas</h1>
<p>Reference: https://everywherewild.com/quokka/</p>
<h2>Habitat</h2>

<p>Quokkas live in trees, shrubs, swamps and other areas with dense vegetation. They do not like the exposure of wide and open spaces.</p>
<p>They prefer environments where they can hide from predators or take shelter from the elements when necessary.</p>

- <h2>1. What does the quokka look like?</h2>
    <p>Quokkas are small, four-legged animals covered in fur. They’re from the kangaroo family and have pouches in their abdomens for carrying their young.
    <p>Though they’re much tinier than kangaroos; the quokka is around the size of a domestic housecat.</p>
    <p>They have narrow faces, round ears, big noses, and tiny paws. Their tails are short and skinny. They’re almost always a shade of brown.</p>
    <p>One of the most distinctive features of the quokka is their smile. Known as “the world’s most cheerful animal,” quokkas have a perpetually happy expression on their face.</p>
    <p>It can range from a tiny smile to a toothy grin, but it’s always there, and it’s always the absolute cutest.</p>
<h2>2. Are quokkas real?</h2>
    <p>Quokkas are very real. Some people doubt their existence because they’re such cute, cuddly creatures, or they get them confused with other species because of their resemblance to different marsupials. But quokkas are a genuine species living in Australia.</p>
<h2>3. How do you pronounce “quokka?”</h2>
    <p>It depends on where you live. North Americans usually pronounce it koo-WOH-kuh, but native Australians favor kah-WAH-kah.</p>
<h2>4. How big is a quokka?</h2>cutequokkaC
    <p>Quokkas are the size of domesticated cats.</p>
    <p>Their bodies measure between 16 – 21 inches long, and their tails are usually 9 – 12 inches long.</p>
<h2>5. How much does a quokka weigh?</h2>
    <p>Male quokkas usually weigh about 5 – 10 pounds. Females are slightly smaller at 3 – 8 pounds.</p> -->
